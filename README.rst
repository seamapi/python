Publishing
~~~~~~~~~~

New versions are created with `poetry version`_.

Automatic
^^^^^^^^^

New versions are released automatically with semantic-release_
as long as commits follow the `Angular Commit Message Conventions`_.

.. _Angular Commit Message Conventions: https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#commit-message-format
.. _semantic-release: https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/

Manual
^^^^^^

Publish a new version by triggering a `version workflow_dispatch on GitHub Actions`_.
The `version` input will be passed as the first argument to `poetry version`_.

This may be done on the web or using the `GitHub CLI`_ with

::

    $ gh workflow run version.yml --raw-field version=<version>

.. _Poetry version: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version
.. _GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
.. _version workflow_dispatch on GitHub Actions: https://github.com/seamapi/python-next/actions?query=workflow%3Aversion

GitHub Actions
--------------

*GitHub Actions should already be configured: this section is for reference only.*

The following repository secrets must be set on GitHub Actions.

- ``PYPI_API_TOKEN``: API token for publishing on PyPI.

These must be set manually.

Secrets for Optional GitHub Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The version, format, generate, and semantic-release GitHub actions
require a user with write access to the repository
including access to read and write packages.
Set these additional secrets to enable the action:

- ``GH_TOKEN``: A personal access token for the user.
- ``GIT_USER_NAME``: The name to set for Git commits.
- ``GIT_USER_EMAIL``: The email to set for Git commits.
- ``GPG_PRIVATE_KEY``: The `GPG private key`_.
- ``GPG_PASSPHRASE``: The GPG key passphrase.
